I am an entrepreneur & HW/SW freelance developer. I care a lot about technology, Linux and online privacy. I'm a proud shareholder of [SigmaDelta.io](https://sigmadelta.io), a company I founded in 2018.

You can contact me on <a href="mailto:blog@sigmadelta.io?subject=Hi Daniel">blog@sigmadelta.io</a> or via Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/dvergeylen">@dvergeylen</a>.

This blog is a mix of personal notes, detailed how-tos and various things I learned over time. Hope you will find something useful!
