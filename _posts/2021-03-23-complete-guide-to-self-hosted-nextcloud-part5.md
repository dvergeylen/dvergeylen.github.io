## Deactivate read only root
When updates are needed or simply updating the configuration is needed, one could need to temporarily deactivate the read only filesystem.

Although `overlayroot` package gives an `overlayroot-chroot` command, don't use it for two reasons:

1. The `/media/root-ro` directory is remounted as `ro` and changes wouldn't persist
2. Packages updates / installation might break because some operations are forbidden in chrooted environment. You might experience some `Running in chroot, ignoring request.` errors.

```bash
sudo mount -o remount,defaults,noatime,rw -t ext4 /dev/mmcblk0p2 /media/root-ro
sudo vim /media/root-ro/etc/overlayroot.local.conf
# ‚Üí Add '#' before `overlayroot="tmpfs:swap=1,recurse=0"` line
sudo reboot

# One liner:
sudo sed -i s/overlayroot/#overlayroot/g /media/root-ro/etc/overlayroot.local.conf
```
